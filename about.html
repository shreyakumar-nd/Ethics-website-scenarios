			<h1 class="display-4">Project Overview</h1>
			<p class="lead">Welcome to the about page of our Ethics Tool! Our project is a dedicated effort to construct an educational resource that fosters ethical awareness among future engineers. Through the development of an interactive website featuring engaging scenarios, we aim to instill thoughtful discussions on the ethical considerations inherent in technology, preparing aspiring engineers with a critical mindset for responsible decision-making in their future endeavors.</p>
			<hr class="my-4">
			<p>Our ongoing project builds upon the groundwork laid in previous semesters, aiming to craft an engaging website dedicated to educating students about engineering ethics. The core of our project lies in developing interactive modules that encourage students to delve into thoughtful discussions surrounding the ethical considerations of technology. While our initial aspirations included code organization, a front-end redesign, and the integration of new features inspired by aesthetically pleasing designs found on other websites through Figma wireframes, our focus strategically shifted.</p>
			<p>Instead of solely chasing design aesthetics, we directed our efforts towards addressing foundational issues. We diligently worked on fixing broken Google Forms, implemented a robust rating system for systematic response evaluation, and introduced modular components to enhance the project's functionality. This shift in emphasis reflects our commitment to laying a solid and functional foundation for the website.</p>
			<p>Navigating the complexities of project development, our dedication to engineering ethics education remains unwavering. The ongoing nature of this initiative extends into the next semester, transforming into a continuous research project. This journey exemplifies the adaptability required in project development to meet the evolving needs of creating a valuable and impactful educational resource.</p>

					<div class="card-content">
						<p class="card-paragraph">Our work on Google Forms involved addressing specific issues such as form validation errors, ensuring a smoother submission process for users. Additionally, we created new forms tailored to distinct learning modules, incorporating interactive elements and scenarios to make the learning experience more dynamic. For instance, one module focused on ethical considerations in algorithmic decision-making, prompting users to engage with relevant content.

					<p class="card-title">Google Apps Script</p>
					<div class="card-content">
						<p class="card-paragraph">To streamline Google Forms processes, we delved into Google Apps Script development. This included scripting to automate form submission and creation, reducing manual efforts for users. For instance, we created scripts that automatically generated forms based on predefined templates, facilitating a quicker and more efficient form creation process. These scripts aimed to enhance the overall functionality of Google Forms within our project.            </p>

					<p class="card-title">Rating System</p>
					<div class="card-content">
						<p class="card-paragraph">The new rating system introduced a structured approach to evaluating user responses. It included specific criteria such as "Common Good of the People," "Self-Interest," "Common Good of Living Things," and "Common Good of the Environment," allowing users to gather feedback on their responses. For example, users could rate the ethical considerations presented in a module based on their decisions, to learn more about the impact of their actions. The system not only provided valuable insights for users but also contributed to the project's analytical capabilities by analyzing and visualizing these ratings.						</p>

					<p class="card-title">Figma Redesign</p>
					<div class="card-content">
						<p class="card-paragraph">Our Figma redesign plan involved a detailed analysis of the current front-end design and a vision for its evolution. We created wireframes and mockups outlining specific changes, such as a more intuitive navigation menu and interactive elements for user form submission and completion. For instance, the redesign included a user-friendly dashboard displaying the available modules and data visualizations of their results. This meticulous planning aimed to enhance the project's visual appeal and user experience while maintaining alignment with ethical considerations integrated into the learning scenarios.
